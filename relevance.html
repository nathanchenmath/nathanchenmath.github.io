          <h3>What This Research Is About</h3>
          <div class="subsection-content">
            <p>My research focuses on fundamental questions in algebraic geometry: How can we measure the complexity of geometric objects? What are the constraints on how these objects can be transformed? How do different types of geometric structures relate to each other?</p>
            
            <p>These questions might seem abstract, but they connect to deep problems across mathematics. The techniques I develop and the results I prove provide tools and insights that other mathematicians use in their own work, often in unexpected ways.</p>
            
            <p>Below, I explain how my specific research areas connect to other branches of mathematics, and why these connections matter for advancing mathematical knowledge.</p>

          <h3>Number Theory & Arithmetic Geometry</h3>
          <div class="subsection-content">
            <p>My work on <strong>abelian surfaces</strong> and their degrees of irrationality connects directly to arithmetic geometry. Abelian varieties are fundamental objects in number theory—they encode arithmetic information and appear in the study of elliptic curves, modular forms, and Diophantine equations.</p>
            
            <p>When I study rational maps from products of curves to surfaces, I'm working on problems that arise naturally in arithmetic geometry. The techniques I develop for measuring irrationality provide new tools for understanding the arithmetic properties of these geometric objects.</p>
            
            <p>While my work doesn't directly solve the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, it contributes to the broader understanding of abelian varieties and their rational maps—knowledge that other researchers use in their work on these deep number-theoretic problems.</p>

          <h3>Birational Geometry & Moduli Theory</h3>
          <div class="subsection-content">
            <p>My research on <strong>Fano varieties</strong> and their birational properties is central to the classification of algebraic varieties. Fano varieties are fundamental building blocks in birational geometry, and understanding their automorphism groups and rational maps is crucial for the broader classification program.</p>
            
            <p>When I investigate whether Fano varieties have finite order birational automorphisms, I'm contributing to our understanding of the birational geometry of these important objects. This work connects to moduli theory—the study of how geometric objects can be classified and parameterized.</p>
            
            <p>My results on measures of irrationality provide new invariants that help distinguish between different types of varieties, which is essential for understanding the structure of moduli spaces.</p>

          <h3>Complex Geometry & Hodge Theory</h3>
          <div class="subsection-content">
            <p>My work on <strong>holomorphic one-forms</strong> and fibrations over abelian varieties connects to complex geometry and Hodge theory. The existence and properties of holomorphic forms are fundamental to understanding the complex structure of algebraic varieties.</p>
            
            <p>When I study fibrations over abelian varieties, I'm working on problems that arise naturally in the study of complex manifolds. The techniques I develop contribute to our understanding of how complex geometric structures can be organized and classified.</p>
            
            <p>This work provides new insights into the relationship between algebraic and complex geometry, which is central to many problems in both fields.</p>

          <div class="subsection-content">
            <p>My research on <strong>complete intersections</strong> and their subvarieties connects directly to commutative algebra. Complete intersections are fundamental objects that arise naturally in algebraic geometry, and understanding their properties is crucial for many problems in the field.</p>
            
            <p>When I study curves on complete intersections, I'm working on problems that require deep understanding of both geometric and algebraic structures. The techniques I develop often involve sophisticated commutative algebra methods.</p>
            
            <p>My work contributes to the broader understanding of how algebraic and geometric structures interact, which is fundamental to algebraic geometry as a whole.</p>
